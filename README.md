1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis financial is a financial firm looking to create services for their consumers to choose different plans that accomodate to their needs. Artemis is also looking to incorporate security so the information that is being transferred is secure. Artemis Financial doesn't want any unauthorized access.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  - I enjoyed the dependency testing to view the vulnerabilities. This means that code must be written securely so that it will provide less of a chance to have weak points. This will allow hackers to tear passed the security wall. Security will add credibility to the company's overall wellbeing. When your consumer's have trust in you and your company then that will attract more clients.
  
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - Only one of the vunerability assessment was challenging for myself and that was identifying the false positives. 
  
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - I made sure to increase the layers of security and an SSL certificate as well as making sure the project has HTTP.
     
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - In order to ensure the code and application was functional and secure, I had to check run a lot, as well as run dependency checks. Refactoring code, I check run the project to see if there were any new vulnerabilities.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  -The most helpful resource utilized would be viewing projects in the web browser in eclipse.
   
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - One assignment I would showcase would be my Vulnerability Assessment Report, to show my understanding of how to find and understand the information being given.
